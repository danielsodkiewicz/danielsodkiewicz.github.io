<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
My name is Daniel Sodkiewicz (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielsodkiewicz/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>). I’m the co-founder of GeekSeller and a passionate enthusiast of artificial intelligence. Over time, I’ve developed a deep understanding of various AI engines, but my primary focus has been on OpenAI. I’ve been using OpenAI’s tools extensively and am most familiar with their ecosystem.
