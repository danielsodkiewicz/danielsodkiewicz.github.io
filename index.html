<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
My name is Daniel Sodkiewicz (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielsodkiewicz/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>). I’m the co-founder of GeekSeller and a passionate enthusiast of artificial intelligence. Over time, I’ve developed a deep understanding of various AI engines, but my primary focus has been on OpenAI. I’ve been using OpenAI’s tools extensively and am most familiar with their ecosystem.

At GeekSeller, I’m leveraging OpenAI to automate processes and create innovative integrations that enhance our business operations. Below is a showcase of some of the OpenAI-powered integrations I’ve built and am excited to share publicly:

<ul>
<li>OpenAI + Zendesk + Slack Integration</li>
<li>GeekSeller AI Support Agent using OpenAI Assistant</li>
<li>OpenAI model trained on the internal data</li>  
</ul>
